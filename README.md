# CO224 - Building a Processor

8-bit single-cycle processor implementation in Verilog HDL for CO224 Computer Architecture course at University of Peradeniya.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations for building a complete 8-bit processor from basic components to a full CPU with memory hierarchy.

## Components Implemented

### Part 1: ALU
- Basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB)
- Logic operations (AND, OR) 
- Data movement (MOV, LOADI)

### Part 2: Register File
- 8×8 register file
- Synchronous write, asynchronous read

### Part 3: Basic CPU
- Integrated ALU and register file
- Control unit implementation
- Program counter

### Part 4: Flow Control
- Jump instructions
- Branch instructions (BEQ)

### Part 5: Extended Instructions
- Multiplication, shift operations
- Additional instruction set

### Part 6: Memory Hierarchy
- **Part 6.1**: Data memory integration
- **Part 6.2**: Data cache implementation  
- **Part 6.3**: Instruction cache

## How to Run

1. Navigate to desired part directory
2. Compile with Icarus Verilog:
   ```bash
   iverilog -o output_file testbench.v module.v
   ```
3. Run simulation:
   ```bash
   vvp output_file
   ```
4. View waveforms:
   ```bash
   gtkwave waveform.vcd
   ```
